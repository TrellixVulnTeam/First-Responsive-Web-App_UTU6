    "<li>Using a medium ice cream scoop, scoop out the dough (it will be wet and gooey) to form cookies onto the lined baking sheets. Be sure to leave about 2 inches of space between each cookie, as the dough will spread during baking.</li>" +
    "<li>If desired, sprinkle a little sea salt on top of each cookie.</li>" +
    "<li>Bake at 350°F for 11-12 minutes, then remove and allow them to sit in the baking sheet for at least 15-20 minutes before eating. The center will be soft and fudgy.</li>" +

Add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients and mix on low-medium speed until just combined. Add the chocolate chips and sprinkles. Mix on low until the add-ins are evenly combined.</li>" +
    "<li>Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate dough for at least 2 hours, or up to 3-4 days. This step is imperative. The dough is fairly sticky, so chilling the dough is required in order to avoid the cookies from spreading too much. If you chill longer than 2 hours, make sure you roll the cookie dough into balls after the 2 hour mark. Place dough balls on a plate, cover tightly, and store in the refrigerator until ready to bake. You may also freeze the balls at this point for up to 3 months. (Then bake as directed adding 1 minute to the bake time without thawing.)</li>" +

    "<li>Scoop rounded balls of the cold dough onto an ungreased baking sheet, use about 1.5 Tablespoons of cookie dough per cookie. Shape your cookie dough balls to be “taller” than they are wide, as pictured above. Make sure to keep dough chilled when working in batches.</li>" +
    "<li>Bake the cookies for 10-12 minutes until edges are lightly browned. The centers will still appear very soft, but the cookies will continue to set as they cool. You can press a few more chips into the tops of the cookies at this point (the chips will stick because the cookies are still warm).</li>" +

For tips and troubleshooting help, check out the post above or see the video.", "Remove cookies from the oven and allow to cool on baking sheets for 4-5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. If the cookies have spread a little more than you like, you can use a spoon to gently push the sides in a bit."]
